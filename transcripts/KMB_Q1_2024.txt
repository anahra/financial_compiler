## Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Kimberly Clark first quarter 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Jakubik. Sir, the floor is yours.
Chris Jakubik -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, head of investor relations at Kimberly Clark, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2024 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly clark.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it to our chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments.
Mike Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thank you, Chris. Hey, before we get into the Q&A, I would like to start by saying thank you to all my colleagues at Kimberly Clark who worked really diligently over the past few years to build our strong foundation and to deliver these Q1 results that provide a very good start to our next chapter of growth. Our strategy to elevate our categories with breakthrough innovation and expand our markets is working.
We are effectively navigating the ever-changing external dynamics of today's new normal while driving our consumer-centric culture. We are making the company better, stronger, and faster. I'm very, very proud of our progress to date, and I'm confident that we're going to continue to leverage our core strengths to achieve our potential. We are on an exciting path and are well-positioned to deliver durable growth and sustainable shareholder returns.
So, with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions.

## Questions & Answers:
[Partial Q&A Transcript]
Operator
Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Mike Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
All right.
Nelson Urdaneta -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good morning. Hope you're all well. First, I have a quick question on your guidance. You reported a better-than-expected Q1, so curious to hear why you didn't pass through the full Q1 beat.
And then also hoping, you know, for a little more color on the better-than-expected volume growth you saw in the quarter. You know, what were the key drivers behind this and, you know, ultimately, how sustainable is this moving forward? And, you know, curious, was there any pull forward, for instance, or should we expect to see continued volume improvements as the year progresses? Thank you.
Mike Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Bonnie. Maybe I'll start, and Nelson will talk about what we decided to pass through and our logic for that. But really, you know, I'm encouraged with our good start. You know, I think our organization is running very, very well in what we would call internally our new normal, right? And I think this is like the first year in a few that we've had kind of a stable business despite a lot of the geopolitical things that are going on.
So, you know, the underlying strength in the quarter was predicated on, you know, couple of good fundamental factors. One, better volume, which you observed, and there was no pull forward. And in fact, it was the opposite. We had an inventory -- retail inventory reduction in the quarter, but kind of -- I think the volume -- the inherent strength in the consumption kind of overshot -- overcompensated for that.
And so, I think that was part one. Also, the market shares are moving kind of in the right direction. So, I think we feel very good about the underlying volume momentum in the business. And then on top of that then, with a stable input cost environment, the productivity that was strong in the quarter tends to drop a little bit stronger through the bottom line.
And so, that's the underlying kind of driver of our strong Q1. And we feel really great about it. The team has done a great job, you know, operating. You know, there are still a couple wars going on in the world, as you're well aware.
Argentina has been very volatile, and our teams are doing a great job there. So, you know, we feel like we're really running well in a new normal environment. Nelson.
Nelson Urdaneta -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And just to add a few details on what happened in Q1, Bonnie. So, first, obviously, very pleased with the start of the year, and Q1 was particularly strong as we saw a significant benefit in China from our Chinese New Year execution; and particularly in March, I mean, the trends in the business continued. China grew volumes double digit in the quarter.
And in North America, in particular, as Mike said, while the trade destock happened as we had projected back in January, and just for perspective, total company, that was around 80 basis points of growth, that still -- we came in March and had a much better consumption in the month in March, which flowed through in the quarter. So, that was the other bit on volume as we thought about what happened and reconciled the numbers for the quarter. Having said that, as we look at what's going to happen in the balance of the year, a couple of things. One, as Mike said, we're cautiously optimistic.
A few things that we're all aware of is we still have geopolitical challenges underway and we have begun to see some of our commodities begin to uptick. Just for perspective, in the first quarter, we've seen how pulp and the fiber complex has increased, you know, in the single digits in the first quarter sequentially versus Q4. For perspective, in the full year, we now expect commodities to be -- you know, the net input cost, the total basket to be around $250 million inflationary. So, we are taking that into account.
