## Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Kimberly Clark's second quarter 2024 earnings question-and-answer session. I will now hand the conference over to Chris Jakubik, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.
Chris Jakubik -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, head of global investor relations at Kimberly Clark, and welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2024 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
We will also make some non-GAAP financial measures today -- or discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberlyclark.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it to our chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments.
Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Chris. Before we jump into the Q&A, I would like to start by saying thank you to my colleagues at Kimberly Clark, who are working diligently on the implementation of our comprehensive innovation like growth strategy and delivered strong results for the first half. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate investments to build our powerhouse categories and brands and our pipeline of innovation. We are effectively navigating external dynamics while driving our consumer-centric culture.
We're making the company better, stronger, and faster, and we are turbocharging our ability to provide better care to consumers around the globe. I'm very proud of our progress to date. It bolsters our confidence in delivering our outlook for the year and our ability to ramp up our investments to further leverage our core strengths and achieve our potential. We are on an exciting path and are well-positioned to deliver durable growth and sustainable shareholder returns.
So, with that, I'd be happy to open it up to questions.

## Questions & Answers:
[Partial Q&A Transcript]
Operator
Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is live.
Lauren Lieberman -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, first, I wanted to check in and talk a little bit, Mike, about market share trends because the organic sales growth this quarter was really solid.
Volumes were up. You had this unexpected headwind from inventory destock. But I wanted to also check in a bit on market share trends, where you stand versus not just competition but also what you're seeing from private label of late. Thank you.
Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Good morning, Lauren. Yeah. Thanks for the question.
Yeah, overall, I feel good about the progress we're making on market share, and I do expect further improvement as we progress through the year. We were overall, globally, even on a weighted basis and up or even in about half of our cohorts around the world. And that's progress versus the past couple of years where, if you recall this time last year, I think we were up or even in about 40% of our cohorts. So, I think we've made solid progress, but there still remains plenty of work for us to do.
As you may recall, Lauren, North America was a bit soft last year. That is improving. That softness last year was primarily due to supply constraints. The first half in North America on a weighted basis was flat and then up or even in about six of eight categories, and that continued in the second quarter.
And I expect further improvement in North America as we cycle some of those constraints last year. We also had pretty solid gains on market share in certain brands across what we're calling focused markets or our other big five markets beyond North America. In China, Huggies was up 180 basis points in share. In the U.K., Andrex, which is the leading brand, it was up 350 basis points.
In South Korea, Huggies has been up over 800 basis points since 2019 and was up over 300 basis points in the quarter. And then in Brazil, I think that we're working to improve the brand proposition, and so we were up about 100 basis points in Brazil. So, we're making progress, but as I pointed out, we're about flat on a weighted basis. And so, that signals that there's plenty of work for us to do.
Lauren Lieberman -- Analyst
OK. Great. And just curious, I know you mentioned a couple of market -- a bunch of market share positions outside of North America and China that have been very strong. But when do we start to see that translate into growth? Because I think one of the interesting parts of the strategy you've laid out and the sort of shifting the focus a bit so that we can get more visibility into the other areas of your business.
But when should we start to see growth become more material and matter more, move the needle more in markets outside of the U.S. and China?
Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, Lauren, I'd say we have a very proven playbook that we're really proud of, and we're implementing that more systematically behind this wiring for growth initiative that we have. We're going to implement those playbooks more systematically around the world. One, we got great technology that the world -- you all haven't seen yet, which we're rolling out, and we're excited about our launch that I mentioned in our opening comments in the script on skin essentials in the U.S.
So, we've got a great technology portfolio. We got the right -- we've been investing in the past five years to build the right commercial and supply capabilities to accelerate performance. You're going to see a sharper focus on what we're calling our focus markets, right? Those are the U.S. plus the next five markets for us.
And so, that said, I would say local conditions remain dynamic. And so, there's plenty of opportunity to tighten up our brand propositions on a market-specific basis. For reference, I'll just tell you Huggies, as I mentioned, was up in share in China. Kotex was flat.
And again, it grew high single digits in the quarter on Kotex, but we'd love to get more share growing in China on fem care. In Brazil, Huggies was up. Kotex is the leading brand, or we call it Intimus in Brazil, the leading brand in Brazil, but share was a little soft and down about just a little bit less than 100 basis points. So, we got some work there.
