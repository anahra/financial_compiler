Thank you, Christina. We delivered another solid quarter with 5% organic growth while cycling 9% growth in the year-ago quarter. Organic sales were up across all segments with personal care and consumer tissue each up 4% and professional at 13%. Our growth strategy is working and our performance in the quarter reflects strong execution by our teams around the world.
We continue to make strong progress in margin recovery. Adjusted gross margin was up 380 basis points and fueled a 17% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 23% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Given the strength of our first half, we're raising our full-year 2023 outlook to 3% to 5% organic growth and 10% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. Our categories remain healthy.
In North America, category sales were up 8%. And we continue to see robust growth in key developed markets including the U.K. and South Korea, which delivered double-digit and mid-single-digit increases, respectively. While category growth across the NEID.
0:00:25.0,P4 been more variable, we continue to see double-digit increases in Latin America. This growth reflects the essential nature of our categories. As category leaders, we've remained focused on serving all our consumers and recognize that many are facing economic challenges. With our broad portfolio, offering value to premium options, we're able to meet consumers where they need us.
And we are well positioned with brands like Scott and Huggies Snug & Dry to serve the value-oriented consumer. Across markets, we're strengthening our price tag offering. And that means enhancing large count packs and big box channels and making entry prices more affordable and small format channels. More importantly, we're accelerating innovation and cascading technology through our product offerings to ensure we're delivering a superior value proposition to consumers.
Growing market share continues to be a top priority. In the quarter, year-over-year market share performance was soft, reflecting the relatively early actions we took to mitigate inflation. In the last six months, price gaps have begun to normalize and we are encouraged to see sequential improvement in market share in key cohorts including North America, where we've seen improvement in five of eight categories. Volume trends have improved, and we expect that to continue as we cycle inflationary measures and execute our strategy and commercial programs.
Our enhanced commercial capabilities are enabling more real-time decision-making that drive sales, optimize brand investment, and balance value and volume. Furthermore, we expect increased brand investment and improved supply fulfillment to strengthen our market share performance over the balance of the year. Our commercial programs and innovation, our corridor strategy to elevate and expand our categories. We're pleased with our launches in the first half and enthusiastic about our second-half plans.
Here are a few highlights. Huggies debut its newest Baby Butts campaign this summer, celebrating Huggies' unique curved design, which provides greater comfort and protection for babies on the move. Early results show excellent consumer engagement across our marketing channels. In China, we're raising the bar on skin health through a proprietary design that whisks away the baby's mess.
Moving the mess away quickly from baby's skin is key to reducing diaper rash. We believe this kind of innovation will further differentiate us from the competition. And as the reason Huggies continues to expand its market leadership in China. Lastly, our Kotex Intimus She Can campaign in Latin America continues to resonate.
We were recently recognized with a prestigious Cannes Lion award for this initiative reducing period stigma as part of menstrual education. In China, Kotex introduced overnight and overnight pad with a proprietary design that prevents leakage with instant absorb technology. Overall around the world, we are seeing growth driven by the overnight segment. This a great example of superior product performance, coupled with effective brand strategy and communications to drive share gains and strong brand equity.
Now I'd like to briefly address the impairment charges to intangible assets we recognize this quarter. We purchased Softex Indonesia to expand our presence in one of the world's fastest-growing personal care markets. Indonesia ranks among the top three markets for new birth and we expect continued economic development will create more demand for our products over time. As a second largest diaper player in Indonesia, representing over a quarter of the market, Softex has built a strong equity with local consumers.
The impairment charges we took this quarter, which Nelson will discuss shortly reflect our updated projections for the business. We have enhanced the team and taken actions to improve the business processes and our go-to-market approach. Indonesia remains an exciting growth market for Kimberly Clark, and we're committed to this business for the long term. Now as we enter the back half, we expect continued progress in our journey to restore and eventually expand our margins.
We're excited about our innovation and commercial plans and will invest more and more brands to improve our market share performance and growth trajectory. This is how we will elevate and expand our categories to deliver balanced and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn it over to Nelson for more details on the second quarter.
Nelson Urdaneta -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. Before I get into second-quarter results, let me take a moment to discuss the divestiture of our Brazil tissue business and the impairment of intangible assets this quarter. We closed the sale of our Brazil tissue business in June, which enables us to focus even more on growth and personal care. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $74 million and $30 million of related expenses, both of which are excluded from our adjusted results this quarter.
I want to thank the many KC-iers who worked hard to complete this transaction. In addition, we conducted strategic reviews forecasting, and integration assessments as part of our business planning cycle. Based on updated financial projections, a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $658 million was recorded, primarily related to intangible assets linked to the Softex acquisition. The charges reflect revise projections for certain brands, due to modified consumer shopping behavior, post-COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and increased competitive activity in the region.
We are confident in the prospects of the personal care market in Indonesia, and we are committed to continue investing in this business. Let me now turn to our second-quarter results. Net sales were $5.1 billion, up 1%. Year over year, organic sales increased 5%.
