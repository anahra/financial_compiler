Thank you, Christina. We delivered another quarter of strong results. I'm proud of how our teams around the world are executing our growth strategy. Our innovation and commercial programs are contributing to the top-line momentum with improving volume and market share trends and strong gross margin expansion.
Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year outlook. Third-quarter and year-to-date organic sales increased 5%, with growth across all segments. personal care, our largest business, led the way with 7% organic growth, and importantly, 2% volume growth. Further gains in price and mix were enabled by strong revenue growth management capability, while volume improved sequentially for a third consecutive quarter.
We expect volume trends to continue improving as we cycle prior pricing actions and continue to invest in our brands. We also continue to make excellent progress on margin recovery. Gross margin was up 530 basis points and exceeded 2019 levels, an important milestone in our commitment to restore our gross margin. Operating profit was up 18%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 24%.
Given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we're raising our 2023 outlook. We now expect organic sales to grow 4% to 5% and adjusted earnings per share to increase 15% to 17%. Global demand in our categories and for our brands remains resilient. In key markets, we're seeing a healthier balance of growth in both price and volume.
In North America Consumer, organic sales were up 7%, with volume up 3%. Dynamics were similar in the EMEA. In China, organic sales and volume were both up double digits despite ongoing category softness. While growth across D&E continues to be mixed, consumption increased double digits in Latin America.
In our largest markets, our market shares are improving. In North America, we saw a sequential improvement in six of eight categories. This was enabled by strong commercial execution, marketing activation, and a significant easing of year-to-date supply constraints in personal care and facial tissue. In the U.K., new performance-enhancing designs, price pack offerings, and digital initiatives have resulted in over 200 basis points of year-over-year share gains for Andrex.
And in China, we're continuing to see strong market share momentum with Huggies share up nearly 200 basis points in the quarter. As market leaders, we're raising the bar by elevating and expanding our categories with superior products and advantaged technology to address unmet needs. We're also committed to meeting consumers where they need us by offering a comprehensive range of products across the value spectrum. I'll highlight a few examples.
In China, we introduced a breakthrough design for Huggies with innovation that whisks away both forms of babies mess to reduce the frequency of diaper rash. This is a foundational element of our global skin health platform. In North America, we launched new Poise 7-drop ultra observancy pads and 8-drop overnight. These higher-capacity designs provide better absorbency in protection than daytime pads.
Also in North America tissue, Scott 1000 lasts longer and dissolve faster, and this has been core to Scott's powerful proposition among value-oriented consumers and it's why Scott continues to deliver robust growth in this important daily use segment. We believe our ongoing investment in advantage technology and brand communications will attract more consumers, increase usage occasions, and ultimately grow our categories. I'm proud of the progress we've made to offset the multiyear impact of inflation on our P&L. Restoring margins to prepandemic levels was a milestone and not our end goal.
We will continue to expand margins by executing our commercial and productivity programs to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. I'll now turn it over to Nelson to provide more details on our third quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Nelson Urdaneta -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong results across the company. Net sales were $5.1 billion, up 2% versus last year. Organic sales increased 5%, led by high single-digit growth in the personal care segment and in North America.
Volume improved sequentially for the third quarter in a row to minus 1%, while price realization was 5% and mix contributed one point of growth. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately 200 basis points. The exit of our Brazil tissue business had an additional impact of 100 basis points, primarily on Consumer Tissue and our Professional business. Let me spend a few minutes on each of our segments.
First, personal care organic sales increased 7% this quarter. Price realization drove 4 points of growth and mix contributed 1%. Volume turned positive for the first time in five quarters, with an increase of 2%. North America and developing and emerging markets organic sales grew in the high single digits, with volume increases in North America.
Developed markets grew low single digits. Within personal care, each of our subcategories grew high single digits. Operating margin for the segment improved 250 basis points versus a year ago, driven by gross margin improvement, while we continue to increase our investments in our brands. Second, organic growth in Consumer Tissue was 2%.
Within Consumer Tissue, North America delivered 4% organic growth, driven by healthy demand in dry bath and towels. Outstanding results from the U.K. drove 2% growth in the developed markets on top of last year's 11% increase. Operating margin for the segment was up 320 basis points versus a year ago, driven by revenue growth management and improved service levels.
Finally, our K-C Professional business posted 4% organic growth despite challenging comparisons against last year. On a two-year average, organic sales growth was 7%. Demand for our washroom business remains healthy and new commercial programs drove share gains in North America. Strong revenue realization was partially offset by lower volumes, which were partly driven by the timing of select planned price adjustments.
Operating margin for Professional improved by 550 basis points, which was broadly in line with the first half of 2023. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Third-quarter gross margin increased 530 basis points to 35.8%. Revenue growth management, input cost tailwinds, and about $90 million in for savings more than offset other manufacturing costs and currency headwinds.
The cost environment remains mixed, with favorability in raw materials offset by higher energy prices, currency headwinds, and higher labor costs. Other manufacturing costs were $30 million higher than last year. Between the lines spending was 20.7% of net sales, up 310 basis points versus a year ago, reflecting year-on-year inflation and investments in our brands, our people, and our capabilities. These results also reflect higher year-on-year incentive compensation accruals.
