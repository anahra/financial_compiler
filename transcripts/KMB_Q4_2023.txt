## Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Kimberly Clark's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call over to Chris Jakubik, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.
Chris Jakubik -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, head of investor relations at Kimberly Clark. And welcome to our Q&A session for our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today.
Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly clark.com.
Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments.
Mike Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thank you, Chris. And first of all, I'd like to just welcome Chris to Kimberly Clark. This is first earnings call with us but his probably triple-digit number in earnings calls that he's done in his career.
So, welcome. Welcome to K-C, Chris. I'd like to just start by sharing that we're really proud of our performance in 2023. But, of course, we're not yet satisfied.
We've built a strong foundation and position Kimberly Clark for our next chapter of growth. These past few years, we've consistently invested to build a consumer-centric organization while navigating unprecedented challenges. Our strategy to elevate our categories and expand our markets is working and we're on an exciting path and positioned to deliver durable growth and returns for shareholders in our next chapter. And as I -- as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're looking forward to detailing our strategic priorities, our long-term algorithm, and outline the key initiatives behind our plans in March.
And so, with that, I'd love to open it up for questions.

## Questions & Answers:

Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.
Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey, guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for next year. Low to mid single digits seems pretty robust relative to the 3% this quarter and just starting out the year lower in Q1. Obviously, you mentioned the 200 basis points from the hyperinflationary markets next year in the prepared remarks, so that's part of it.
Maybe, A, give us a sense of how much those markets contributed in Q4. And then, just as you look at the base business ex those markets, maybe some commentary on pricing versus volume and what you're expecting? And if you could also just touch on market share performance in Q4. The U.S. track channels are weaker.
So, just any update on how you're feeling about your market share performance and plans on that front as you look out to '24 would be helpful. Thanks.
Mike Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Hey, thanks, Dara. Maybe I'll start with -- maybe as you kind of tee up there, the state of the consumer, particularly in developed markets, I'd say, our underlying category growth across personal care, consumer tissue, and professional remains pretty robust both in absolute terms and I think if you look across in relative to other broader staples. Our products, I'll remind you, are daily essentials, and unlike some categories, substitution of our categories is fairly low.
On top of that, we still have a lot of room for penetration and revenue per user gains, and so we're working on that. So, overall, I think the consumer right now still remains -- despite what, you might argue, is a fairly mixed kind of consumer picture, the consumer remains pretty healthy. We're confident in our ability to elevate our categories and expand the markets further. The consumer picture, I said is somewhat mixed.
Employment remains strong. Wage growth is up. But I think it's also probably fair to say, from our side that, the full effects of all the rate hikes and all the economic policy impacts are not fully materialized in the consumers. So, that all said, the categories were pretty robust.
In North America, just to give you a reference point, North America category value was up six in the fourth quarter and up eight for the year. So, that's a pretty solid number. Again, I'll chalk that up to the fact that there's low substitution in our categories. And that makes our categories a lot more resilient than other staples categories that I've worked in the past.
We still also, Dara, see pretty good demand for premium products, and we're seeing that in a broad array of markets, including in North America. Surprisingly, you might say in a market like Argentina is still, Brazil, China, of course. And so, we're very enthused about our approach with elevating our categories and expanding our markets, and we believe that still working and still appropriate, even though we recognize we've got to be able to offer great value at all price tiers. So, I'll pause there.
I know that I threw a lot at you. So, I know there were multiple parts to your question. I don't know, Dara, if you wanted to -- Nelson, if you want to --
Nelson Urdaneta -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. There was a question on the decomposition of our top-line growth for the year and how it relates to Q4. Let me address that a little bit, Dara. I think to recap, the fourth quarter was a quarter in which we attained flat volumes, and pricing was only 2% of the contribution, with mix being 1%.
That 2% was largely hyperinflationary economies. And as you think about this year, this is going to be a year in which we see volumes beginning to pick up from Q2 on. And we expect pricing to be in that 200 basis point range, right in-line with what we saw in the last quarter of the year and that pricing is really going to be driven based on what we expect today by hyperinflationary economies. So, the profile is really on the pricing side, very similar to what we saw in Q4.
